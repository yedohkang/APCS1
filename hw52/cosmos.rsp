Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

This was actually SO FREAKING COOL!!!! The visuals were really cool and I was just in awe the entire time! The calendar also kind of shook me because everything that really happened in our world only occurred in the last, minute or so?! But overall, I really enjoyed it. Although I have different views as Tyson on some stuff, I learned a lot and developed a slight interest in this! I also liked the small, inspiring commentary that he makes throughout the entire episode, especially how we, humans, had to learn that we weren't the center anymore but that we had to work together. It's the little things that matter the most, like how that one inch allowed our whole entire galaxy/system to be formed, or how just one message from the scientist changed Tyson's perspective. I also learned that the scientific method was one of the greatest things invented, because it allows us to reject bad ideas, explore, discover, and try out new ideas.

I feel like this was more of a history-science lesson. I honestly didn't know about the feud between Hooke and Newton, but now I know! And it still shows to stand that Newton is the one who gets recognized for HIS own discoveries. The things I learned about Halley was amazing, and now I know that Halley's comet is named after him! I honestly don't have much to say, but the world has developed so much, especially with the scientific discoveries that have allowed us to be where we are today.

I really enjoyed this one too! Michael's Faraday story was really interesting, and it showed that if you put your mind to it, you can do it. I also learned that small things matter, just like how his few years at the glass factory helped him solve the mystery and the connection between the magnet, electricity and light. I also learned that education is important, because although Faraday showed all these cool electricity and magnet related things, people could not fully agree with him becuase Faraday could not prove it mathematically. Overall, these few episodes were super interesting and I'm definitely positive that I might watch a few more!
