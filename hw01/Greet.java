/* 
Similarities: use functions and their regular syntax; have parameters; quotes around the text
Differences: Scheme and Python use much simpler syntax and language such as display, define, print, 	return, etc. while Java uses a lot of confusing words (as of right now) to create a simple function. 
	Java also uses more than parantheses-- it uses braces and brackets as well. There is also a semicolon 
	used as well as periods. I'm also going to assume, but in the Java function, it specifically states
	the audience it is directed to (public class), and states its condition (dynamic or static?) while
	Python and Scheme is directed towards everyone.
